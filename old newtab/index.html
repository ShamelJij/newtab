          <p>The masterpiece of my pranks was an incident in a student dormitory. One day I woke up
            I woke up very early, around 5:00 a.m., and couldn't go back to sleep. So I
            went downstairs from my bedroom and found a note hanging on the strings,
            which said: "Door, door, who stole the door?" I looked around and I saw
            someone had taken the door off its hinges and put a sign in its place that said:
            "Please close the door," a sign that usually hung on the
            the missing door.
            I immediately guessed what this was all about. There was a guy named
            Pete Bernays and two others. If you wandered into their room looking for something.
            or to ask them how they'd solved a problem, you'd always hear these guys moaning.
            "Please close the door!"
            Someone undoubtedly got fed up with this and the door was taken away.
            I should say there were two doors in this room, the way it was
            the way it was built. So I had an idea: I took the other door off its hinges,
            I took it downstairs and hid it in the basement behind the fuel oil tank. Then I quietly
            went up to my room and went to bed.
            Later in the morning I pretended to wake up, and went downstairs a little
            a little late downstairs. The other students were fidgeting about, and Pete and his friends were
            extremely upset: the doors to their room were off, and they had to study, etc., etc.
            et cetera, et cetera. As I was coming down the stairs, they asked, "Feynman, did you
            got the doors?"
            - Um, yes," I replied. - I took the door. You see the scratches on my
            on my fingers, I got them from pulling down the basement door when my hands were scraping against the
            the wall.</p>
